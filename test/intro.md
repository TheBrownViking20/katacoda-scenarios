## Understanding word embeddings using Python
In this scenario, you will learn about the concepts and methods behind the widely used word embeddings using python. You will learn how text is converted into a form that can be used by various softwares and algorithms. We will learn how vectors are used in these text data intensive scenarios. We will use the following python libraries:
* `Numpy` and `Scipy` for numeric and scientific computation
* `Scikit-learn` for for text based transformers
*  `nltk` and `gensim` for Natural Language Processing

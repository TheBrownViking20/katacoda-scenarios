## Regularization in regression using Python

In this scenario, you will learn how to use regularization in linear regression models effectively. We will use pandas for data loading and data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.

### What is linear regression?
Linear Regression attempts to find a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explantory (or independent) variables. Linear regression can be used for various tasks.For example, a given dataset has data about locations of houses in a state/province, their prices, their architecture, their neighborhood, etc. This dataset can be used to estimate the prices for houses (which may not have been listed yet) in that particular state. This is useful for house owners, potential buyers, and real estate agencies.

Other uses of regression are:
* Stock price prediction
* Weather forecasting
* Predictive analysis from survey data
* Market research studies
* Future sales prediction and much more

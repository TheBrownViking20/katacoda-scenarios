# <p align="center">Fundamental Linear Algebra using Python</p>

## What is Linear Algebra?
Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and matrices. It is the mathematics of data, dealing with its creation, representation, transformation, and consumption using various concepts of vectors and matrices.

## Why you should study Linear Algebra?
In the world of data science, data is not only represented in the form of vectors and matrices but is also researched and transformed using various concepts of linear algebra. This makes it essential to know the concepts of linear algebra to better understand the inner workings of various machine learning models and algorithms. 

### What will you learn in this scenario?
This scenario is a part of a five-part set of katacoda scenarios. These scenarios aim to teach Linear Algebra with special emphasis on coding examples and good visualization practices. This is achieved using Python and its libraries like Numpy, Matlplotlib, etc. In this scenario, you will learn the following:
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Eigendecomposition
* Matrix diagonalization

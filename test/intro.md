## Linear Algebra in image processing using Python
In this scenario, you will learn how to implement various image processing techniques using matrix operations and transformations using Python. We will explore the core concepts and processes behind basic image transformations. We will use the following python libraries:
* `Numpy` and `Scipy` for numeric and scientific computation
* `Matplotlib` for plotting images
* `Pillow` or PIL for loading and manipulating images

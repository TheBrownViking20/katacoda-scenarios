## Linear Regression from Scratch Using NumPy

In this scenario, you will learn how to create linear regression algorithms from scratch using NumPy, a library for numeric computing in Python. Building linear regression algorithms using just mathematical formulas and linear algebra provides in-depth knowledge about the algorithm's inner working and helps in building intuition in future use cases. We will be using other Python libraries for this tutorial. We will use pandas for data loading and data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.

### What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression attempts to find a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory (or independent) variables. Linear regression can be used for various tasks.For example, a given dataset has data about locations of houses in a state/province, their prices, their architecture, their neighborhood, etc. This dataset can be used to estimate the prices for houses (which may not have been listed yet) in that particular state. This is useful for house owners, potential buyers, and real estate agencies.

Other uses of regression are:
* Stock price prediction
* Weather forecasting
* Predictive analysis from survey data
* Market research studies
* Future sales prediction and much more

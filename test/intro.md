## Spectral clustering from scratch using Python
In this scenario, you will learn how to implement spectral clustering from scratch using python and compare its performance with its alternatives. We will use the following python libraries:
* `Numpy` and `Scipy` for numeric and scientific computation
* `Matplotlib` for visualization
* `Scikit-learn` for clustering

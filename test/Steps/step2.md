In the Jupyter workspace, **RegL1.ipynb** and **RegL2.ipynb** are the notebooks we will use for the tutorial and **data.csv** is the dataset used for linear regression.

### L2 regularization
Ridge regression or L2 regularization brings values of coefficients near zero to enforce regularization.

Once you are done with L1 regularization, click on **RegL2.ipynb** to start the jupyter notebook for L2 regularization. A new browser tab named RegL2 should open. Now, you can follow the tutorial in your jupyter notebook.

### L1 regularization
Lasso regression or L1 regularization not only brings values of coefficients near zero but to exact zero in case of weak regressors. So, it not only shrinks coefficient estimates towards zero but also helps in feature selection.

Click on **RegL1.ipynb** to start the jupyter notebook for L1 regularization. A new browser tab named RegL1 should open. Now, you can follow the tutorial in your jupyter notebook.

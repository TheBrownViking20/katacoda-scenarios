In the Jupyter workspace, **RegL1.ipynb** and **RegL2.ipynb** are the notebooks we will use for the tutorial and **data.csv** is the dataset used for linear regression.

Click on **RegL1.ipynb** to start the jupyter notebook for L1 regularization. A new browser tab named RegL1 should open. Now, you can follow the tutorial in your jupyter notebook.

Once you are done with L1 regularization, click on **RegL2.ipynb** to start the jupyter notebook for L2 regularization. A new browser tab named RegL2 should open. Now, you can follow the tutorial in your jupyter notebook.

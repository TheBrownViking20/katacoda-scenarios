## Rotation
We can rotate all vectors in a vector space through an angle  ùúÉ  either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let's create a customizable linear transformation function for rotation and then plot the results. Let's create a customizable linear transformation function for scaling and then plot the results.

#### A customizable linear transformation for rotation
<pre>
def rotation(v,clockwise=False,degree=90):
    # Degree to radian
    radian = np.radians(degree)
    if clockwise==False:
        m = np.matrix([[np.cos(radian),-np.sin(radian)],
                  [np.sin(radian),np.cos(radian)]])
    else:
        m = np.matrix([[np.cos(radian),np.sin(radian)],
                  [-np.sin(radian),np.cos(radian)]])
    return m @ v
</pre>

Following is the vector space we plotted in Step 1. Let's see how applying the scaling transformation changes this vector space.

Run `vector.py` using the following command:

`python3 vector.py`{{execute}} (This code doesn't produce any output on the terminal.)

Click and view the newly formed `rvs.png`{{open}} file from the VScode sidebar.

The resulting vector space is tilted towards right.

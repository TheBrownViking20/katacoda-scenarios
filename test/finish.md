**Conclusion:** In this case, L1 regularization has not been very effective in variable selection and regularization. This might have happened due to the large coefficient of `Feat10`. Also, in case of L2 regularization, the coefficients of almost all variables were close to zero so not much decrease in value of coefficients was seen for variables other than `Feat10`.

### Learning outcomes
* Use regularization techniques to improve the results of regression techniques
* Use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
* Use regularization techniques to identify important features

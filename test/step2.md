## Linear transformations on vector space
Applying linear transformations on vectors or vector spaces is like applying functions on them. A linear transformation L(x) is applied on vector x results in vector y such that

**L(x) = y**
 
Linear transformations should follow the following properties:

* **L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)**

* **L(cx) = cL(x)** 
 
where x, y ùúñ R<sup>n</sup> and c ùúñ R. R<sup>n</sup> is a vector space of n dimensions and R is the set of real numbers.

Linear transformations can even map a vector from one vector space to another. This is represented as

**L : V ‚Üí W**
 
where V and W are vector spaces.

For example, L(x) is a linear transformation such that

The above linear transformation converts a 2 √ó 1 vector into a 3 √ó 1 vector. Let's check if L(x) satisfies both conditions using numpy. Copy the following code to the editor:

<pre class="file" data-filename="vector.py" data-target="replace">
# Importing numpy
import numpy as np
# Create matrices x and y
x = np.matrix([[1],
              [2]])
y = np.matrix([[4],
              [5]])
# Real number c
c = 2

# Linear transformation defined as a function
def L(v):
    return np.matrix([[float(v[0])],
                     [float(v[1])],
                     [float(v[0])+float(v[1])]])

# Applying linear transformation L on matrix x
x_new = L(x)
# Print the resulting matrix
print(x_new)

</pre>

Run `vector.py` using the following command:

`python3 vector.py`{{execute}}

Now that we have defined the matrices belonging to vector space R<sup>2</sup> and the linear transformation L, we verify the properties of linear transformations:

* **L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)**

Append the following code to the editor:

<pre class="file" data-filename="vector.py" data-target="append">
print("Verifying L(x+y) = L(x + y)")
# LHS
print("L(x+y) =")
print(L(x+y))
# RHS
print("L(x)+L(y) =")
print(L(x) + L(y))
# Verifying LHS = RHS
print("Verified?")
# np.allclose checks if two arrays are truly identical
print(np.allclose(L(x+y),L(x) + L(y)))
</pre>

Run `vector.py` using the following command:

`python3 vector.py`{{execute}}

* **L(cx) = cL(x)**

Append the following code to the editor:

<pre class="file" data-filename="vector.py" data-target="append">
print("Verifying L(cx) = cL(x)")
# LHS
print("L(cx) =")
print(L(c*x))
# RHS
print("cL(x) =")
print(c*L(x))
# Verifying LHS = RHS
print("Verified?")
print(np.allclose(L(c*x),c*L(x)))
</pre>

Run `vector.py` using the following command:

`python3 vector.py`{{execute}}

Hence, we have verified both properties for linear transformation L(x). It is a valid linear transformation.
